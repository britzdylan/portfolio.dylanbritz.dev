Ever wanted to automate repetitive tasks without paying for a dedicated server? GitHub Actions offers a powerful (and free!) solution for running scheduled tasks also known as cron jobs. Whether you need to sync data, generate reports, or even run a web scraper on schedule, this guide has you covered!

## What Are GitHub Actions Scheduled Workflows?

GitHub Actions lets you automate tasks based on various triggers, including time-based schedules using cron syntax. The best part? It's completely free for public repositories, with generous free minute allocations for private repos too.

## Setting Up Your First Scheduled Workflow

### 1. Create or Choose Your Repository

Remember that public repositories have unlimited free minutes, while private repos get around 2000 minutes/month on free plans.

### 2. Add a Workflow File

Create a new file at `.github/workflows/cron-job.yml` in your repository.

### 3. Define Your Schedule Using Cron Syntax

Here's a simple example that runs every day at midnight (UTC):

```yaml
name: Daily Cron Job

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Every day at midnight UTC

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run script
        run: echo "Scheduled job ran at $(date -u)"
```

### 4. Understanding Cron Syntax

Cron expressions use five fields representing:

- Minute (0-59)
- Hour (0-23)
- Day of Month (1-31)
- Month (1-12)
- Day of Week (0-6, where Sunday = 0)

Here are some common patterns:

| Cron Expression | What It Does                |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `0 0 * * *`     | Every day at midnight UTC   |
| `*/5 * * * *`   | Every five minutes          |
| `0 13 * * 1`    | Every Monday at 1:00 PM UTC |

Pro tip: Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to test your cron expressions!

## Best Practices for GitHub Actions Cron Jobs

### Mind the Time Zone

All GitHub Actions schedules run in UTC. Make sure to adjust your schedule accordingly if you need tasks to run at specific local times.

### Schedule Strategically

- The minimum interval allowed is every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- Avoid scheduling exactly on the hour (`0 * * * *`) to prevent delays due to high demand
- You can set multiple schedules in one workflow to create complex timing patterns

### Choose the Right Environment

By default, jobs run on Ubuntu, but you can specify `runs-on: windows-latest` or `macos-latest` if your tasks need a specific operating system.

## Real-World Example: Scheduled Web Scraper

Want to collect data from a website daily? Here's how to set up a Python web scraper to run every morning:

```yaml
name: Scheduled Web Scraper

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *' # Every day at 6am UTC

jobs:
  scrape:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run scraper
        run: python scraper.py
```

This will run your scraper automatically at 6 AM UTC every day.

## Why Choose GitHub Actions Over Alternatives?

| Feature     | GitHub Actions            | Traditional Cron          | Cloud Schedulers             |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Setup       | Simple YAML in repo       | Requires server access    | Cloud configuration          |
| Cost        | Free for public repos     | Free (but needs a server) | Usually requires payment     |
| Maintenance | Managed by GitHub         | Your responsibility       | Minimal but requires account |
| Best for    | Code projects, automation | Local tasks               | Production systems           |

## Tips

1. **Test your workflows** manually before scheduling them to catch any issues
2. **Use GitHub Secrets** for storing API keys or sensitive information
3. **Add conditions** to make your workflows smarter using the `if:` syntax
4. **Monitor your usage** if you're using private repositories to avoid exceeding free minutes

GitHub Actions scheduled workflows give you a free, flexible way to automate recurring tasks without managing servers or paying for third-party schedulers. Whether you're running maintenance scripts, syncing data, or creating automated reports, these cloud-based cron jobs integrate seamlessly with your existing GitHub workflow.
