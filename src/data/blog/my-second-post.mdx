Debugging is an essential skill for any developer. Here are some techniques I've found invaluable during my coding journey.

## Console Methods Beyond console.log()

While `console.log()` is great, there are more powerful debugging tools available:

```javascript
// Group related logs
console.group('User Data');
console.log('Name:', userName);
console.log('Role:', userRole);
console.groupEnd();

// Time operations
console.time('fetchData');
await fetchData();
console.timeEnd('fetchData');
```

## Browser DevTools Tips

1. Use breakpoints strategically
2. Monitor network requests
3. Check performance bottlenecks
4. Utilize watch expressions

## Common Debugging Pitfalls

Here are some issues I frequently encounter:

- Forgetting to check data types
- Not handling edge cases
- Overlooking scope issues
- Ignoring error boundaries

## Quick Tips

> "If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in." - Edsger Dijkstra

Remember to:

- Read the error message carefully
- Test one change at a time
- Document your fixes
- Use version control

Happy debugging! 🐛
